# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## Algorithms
* algorithm: any-well defined __computational procedure__ that takes __input__ and produce __output__
* 알고리즘이란 입력을 받아 결과를 출력하는 잘 정의된 계산적 절차

### what kinds of problems are solved?
* Hunam genome project
* manage and manipulate large volumen of data on Internet
* E-commerce
* details
  - determine the shortest route
  - find a lognest common subsequence
  
* two characteristics
  - they have many __candiate solutions__  
  (다수의 후보군 중 가장 적합한 답을 찾아내는 문제)
  - they have __practical__ applications  
  (실용적인 문제)
 
### Data structure
* a way to __store and organize__ data

### Technique
### Hard problems
### Parallelism


## Algorithms as a technology

### Efficiency
* Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency

### Other technology
* require algorithmic content at application level
* solve large problems than ever before
